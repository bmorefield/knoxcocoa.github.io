## May

Most mobile apps need some sort of server backend. Traditionally this required knowing the 
complex aspects of setting up and managing Unix or Windows servers. That's no longer the case.
This month Bill Morefielld ([@bmorefield](https://twitter.com/bmorefield)) will present an
overview of several methods to get you back end up and running. We'll look at containers, hosted services,
and running your own server as options and the pros and cons of each approach.

## April

The Realm Mobile Database is an alternative to SQLite and Core Data that is
available for Java, Objective-C, Swift, Javascript, and Xamarin. The database
is fast, easy to use, open source, and totally free. It can be readily synced
to a server with the Realm Mobile Platform for creating offline-first, reactive
mobile apps. This month Gavin Wiggins ([@wigging](https://twitter.com/wigging))
will give an overview of Realm's products and demonstrate some of its most
useful features. More information about Realm is available at
[realm.io](https://realm.io).
