## March

This month we'll have an open discussion on the latest Apple news and develop
an agenda for the rest of 2017. This is a good opportunity to volunteer for an
upcoming presentation or suggest topics we should talk about at future
meetings.

## February

To support the local developers community, we encourage everyone to attend the
KnoxDevs quarterly meetup on February 2nd. So this month there will be no
CocoaHeads meeting, but we'll resume our regular monthly meeting in March.

## January

This month we'll discuss the latest news in Swift programming along with an
overview of the Weather API provided by the Weather Underground. More
information about this API is available at https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api
