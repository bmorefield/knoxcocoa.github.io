## April

The Realm Mobile Database is an alternative to SQLite and Core Data that is
available for Java, Objective-C, Swift, Javascript, and Xamarin. The database
is fast, easy to use, open source, and totally free. It can be readily synced
to a server with the Realm Mobile Platform for creating offline-first, reactive
mobile apps. This month Gavin Wiggins ([@wigging](https://twitter.com/wigging))
will give an overview of Realm's products and demonstrate some of its most
useful features. More information about Realm is available at
[realm.io](https://realm.io).
